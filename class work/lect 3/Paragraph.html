        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO PARAGRAPH TAG</h1>
        <p> A hero could have very many different definitions, like it could be a role model of yours, or it could be a hero from ancestry. My definition of a hero would be someone that has super natural abilities and uses those abilities to help keep people from damage. There are many different heroes in the world and i chose to write about Iron Man because not only is he an awesome hero, but he is also a very successful person, being the owner of Starks Industry, and making it better by improving the weapons they make. At the same time that he is saving the world he is also a very hard working person.</p>
